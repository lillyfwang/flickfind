Design: 
I chose this to be my design because I need to make sure the images were the same size. When the images are not the same size, the overall website looks messy and not aesthetically pleasing. To make it more minimal in design, I made the information about the photo only appear when you hover over the image. I also knew that I didn't want the search bar to distract the user, so I hid it whenever the user was browing the photos. I also made sure that the design was responsive to the window size so users can view the website seamlessly when they adjust the window and on any mobile or tablet device.
